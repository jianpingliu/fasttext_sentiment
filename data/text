1,,For anyone out there that uses WindStream as their internet or voice provider I sure do feel sorry for you. WindStream customer service is a joke! Our phone service has been dropping calls and at times doesn't work at all! I contacted WindStream almost a week ago now and I've had countless trouble tickets submitted all being solved out without the problem actually being resolved... Every time I call in I get transferred about a half a dozen times only to get a promise from the rep that a technican would be giving me a call with an update on the ticket.   We have been having issues since the last week of September....   We are porting to another carrier in about a month and I could not be happier.   Thanks for making our I.T. department look like a bunch of jack asses wind stream, much appreciated!
